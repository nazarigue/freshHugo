Many countries regulate the usage of national language by the law in order to preserve languages and make information available for the people. Recently there was a reminder for example in Estonia, that companies should have either the whole website or at least the summary of the services available in the Estonian language.

## Here's how to do that quickly and free of charge in Aligner

#### 1. Write a summary of your services

#### 2. Go to [app.aligner.io](https://app.aligner.io) and create a new document, then just paste your summary
