There are many ways today how to translate your websites. Services like [Crowdin]([Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)), [Phrase](https://phrase.com), [Lokalise](https://phrase.com/) and others provide deep integrations with their systems to continuously improve the localisation. 
### There are 5 problems that will not make you use them:

1. Monthly pricing gets up to 100 USD with multiple languages
2. Developers work included
3. Long onboarding
4. Not collaborative
5. Only strings supported

All of these platforms are built for bigger companies and require a more technical approach. In Aligner, it happens a lot easier.
