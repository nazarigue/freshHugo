Many countries regulate the use of language by law in order to preserve languages and make information available for locals. Recently there was a reminder for example in Estonia, that companies should have either website or a summary of the services available in Estonian.

## Here's how to do that quickly and for free in Aligner

#### 1. Write a summary of your services


#### 2. Go to [app.aligner.io](https://app.aligner.io) and create a new document, paste your summary
