There are many ways today how to translate your websites. Services like [WPML](www.wpml.org "WPML"), [Weglot](https://weglot.com/), and others provide deep integrations with their systems to continuously improve the localisation.

### There are 5 problems that will not make you use them:

1. Monthly pricing gets up to 100 USD with multiple languages
2. Developers work included
3. Long onboarding
4. Not collaborative
5. Complex to use

All of these platforms are built for larger companies and require a more technical approach.

In Aligner, it happens a lot easier, faster, and requires no programming skills.

### In Aligner, you can translate your websites already today.

## 1. Open your website and copy the text
