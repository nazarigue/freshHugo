### One of the biggest time-managment failures is to spend time on writing emails, instead of using specialised easy-to-use software.

People tend to be stuck in communication and information gaps all the time. Today, we work already in real-time collaboration and notification tools like [Slack](https://www.slack.com "Slack"), integrate it with [Jira](https://www.slack.com "Jira"), connect it to [Mailchimp](https://www.slack.com "Mailchimp"). Everything is under control.

> But we have an issue when it comes to managing multilingual documentation. Would it be a blog, knowledgebase, support materials or marketing content. We get stuck.

## 4 reasons why managing multiple languages is difficult

- you can't work in a set mode. You can edit only one language and need other people to fix all others
- keeping in loop all people creates communication gaps
- updating content means working with multiple files and keeping track change in all of them
- content can get to managing hundreds of files

## Current tools are not sufficient

Some try to build string-like solutions in [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/ "Google Sheets") but it does not work either for non-string content. One of the options:
![Solving translation with Google Sheets](https://www.labnol.org/images/2008/translate_spreadsheet_cells.png "Solving translation with Google Sheets").

## 3 main problems that Google Sheets can't handle
- Style. You can't style and do preps for the web.
- Structure. You can't have different structures for different languages.
- Does not handle interactive images like bullets, tables and images
