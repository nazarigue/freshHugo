Today, a lot of companies shifted to new Platforms like [Notion](https://www.notion.so "Notion"), [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper "Dropbox Paper") or [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence "Atlassin Confluence")

- A structure is never broken, clean and systematic approach
- Mobile friendly
- Connect to apps like [Slack](https://www.slack.com "Slack"), [Jira](https://www.slack.com "Jira"), [Discord](https://discordapp.com/ "Discord")
